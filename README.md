# Overview

As a aspiring software engineer committed to improving programming knowledge and skills, I undertook the development of this project in the C++ language that spans across eight distinct modules. Each module is designed to showcase different concepts in C++, ranging from the basics of variables and expressions to the implementation of a fully functional Basic Inventory System. This project serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

Description of my Basic Inventory System: This system simulates a practical application, managing a shopping list with items, prices, and quantities. The user is prompted to pick between five options, view, add, remove, edit, and quit. Depending on the option selected they are then prompted to fill out the relevant information to ultimately build their shopping list.

In summary, this comprehensive C++ project serves as a testament to my dedication to improving my programing skills. It demonstrates my progression from foundational concepts to the practical implementation of a complex system, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a software engineer.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Create a GUI that allows the user to add items to their shopping list by pressing buttons instead of selecting numbers.
- Implement some kind of inventory/stock system so the user can select from preexisting items that are on sale.
- Allow the user to send their list via text or email from the application.
